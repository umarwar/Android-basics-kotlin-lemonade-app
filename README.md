# Android-basics-kotlin-lemonade-app
This project is an interactive Android application where the user can click on a lemon image to simulate the process of making lemonade. The state and displayed elements change based on the user's actions, such as picking lemons, squeezing them, drinking the lemonade, and restarting the process. Additionally, a snackbar shows the number of times the lemon has been squeezed when the lemon image is long-pressed in the "squeeze" state.
